# VigenereCipher-C/C++
Program C/C++ to encrypt and decrypt a plaintext with unknown key

# How to run?
  -> Create a file **test.txt** and paste a plaintext to encrypt it. ( Optional if you want only to decrypt)\
  -> Create a file **out.txt**.\
  -> Type **make** to compile all needed files, then **make run** to run. Use **make clean** for remove the old compiled files\
  -> You'll have the length of key, the key, the coincidence and the decrpted text.\
  -> Obs : If you want just to decrypt, just fullfill the **out.txt** with your ciphertext, compile using **gcc main.c -o filename** then run using **./filename** .
  
  **Enjoy!**
